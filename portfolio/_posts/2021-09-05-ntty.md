_Pronounced entity or neovim tty_

# Problem

Handling run commands is difficult. There are multiple tech stacks, `docker-compose.yml`
files, `Makefile`s, `package.json`s and even if you condense everything into
1 command, typing them over and over, creating a new tmux window, launching a new
terminal and frequently leaving your text editor to run something is simply too
much time wasted you could have potentially spent on an intern's code review to
save your company from another production hazard.

# Solution

ntty is a terminal manager that handles multiple neovim terminals and allows you
to interface with them while in a file buffer. Context switching between
terminal buffers and your file becomes much easier.

The main feature of ntty is to cache your projects run commands for a specific
terminal buffer and it does that using sqlite and with a longest prefix
matching logic that remembers which command to run in the terminal buffer based
on your current path.

```
Assuming you stored command `docker-compose up` while in `~/core/project` folder

Use longest prefix matching to get the run instruction if the current neovim instance is
in `~/core/project/src`.
